    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Student's t Random Numbers

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Create a [readable stream][readable-stream] for generating pseudorandom numbers drawn from a [Student's t][t] distribution.









<!-- Section for describing a command-line interface. -->



<section class="cli">



<section class="installation">

## Installation

To use as a general utility, install the CLI package globally

```bash
npm install -g @stdlib/random-streams-t-cli
```

</section>
<!-- CLI usage documentation. -->


<section class="usage">

## Usage

```text
Usage: random-t [options] <v>

Options:

  -h,  --help               Print this message.
  -V,  --version            Print the package version.
       --sep sep            Separator used to join streamed data. Default: '\n'.
  -n,  --iter iterations    Number of pseudorandom numbers.
       --seed seed          Pseudorandom number generator seed.
       --state filepath     Path to a file containing the pseudorandom number
                            generator state.
       --snapshot filepath  Output file path for saving the pseudorandom number
                            generator state upon exit.
```

## Notes

-   In accordance with POSIX convention, a trailing newline is **always** appended to generated output prior to exit.
-   Specifying a "snapshot" file path is useful when wanting to resume pseudorandom number generation due to, e.g., a downstream failure in an analysis pipeline. Before exiting, the process will store the pseudorandom number generator state in a file specified according to a provided file path. Upon loading a snapshot (state), the process will generate pseudorandom numbers starting from the loaded state, thus avoiding having to seed and replay an entire analysis.
